While this library does not depend on third-party code, I am grateful to the following projects for both inspiration and the feature integrations they make possible:

* Parts of the API were inspired by [format-message](https://github.com/format-message/format-message), Copyright &copy; 2015 Andy VanWagoner.

* Build-time compilation of ICU messages is provided by [MessageFormat](https://messageformat.github.io/messageformat/), Copyright &copy; 2012-2018 Alex Sexton, Eemeli Aro, and Contributors.

* [ICU](http://site.icu-project.org/) (International Components for Unicode) and its syntax are Copyright &copy; 1991-2018 Unicode.

* [React](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org) is Copyright &copy; 2013-2018 Facebook.
